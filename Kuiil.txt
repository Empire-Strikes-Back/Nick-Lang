how hard can it be?! well, turned out like Top Gear's crossing of La Manche on first day
crew of adventure ship of Triplanetary's Top Gear-like show went through uncharted nebula while filming their special near the edge of mapped space - in the wild of the Galaxy
they made it through nebula, but something malfunctioned - and there was no Rey near to bypass the compressor - ship auto-piloted an emergency landing on a newer  on an uninhabitet planet near the nebula and went offline
crew had to abandon ship and were picked up
the story went into the news right away - crew joking that "we ma need a rifle" like Hammond in Botswana standing shoulders deep in the water with Oliver drowned
now what's interesting - now with those news everyone knowns there is a ship with rich data on board about nebula and how to get through it
crew also decribed the planet's flora as "looked like  NBA players' dressing style"

so, El, Ar, Bib and Cee turn up on near the newer planet with the ship parked on it, each as part of their own separate party, uncoordinated
El aboard of research ship - they heard about the dressing style planet within and are like "wait a minute, if we get the data from ship, we can go in and research new wildlife and stuff"
Cee aboard transport ship - the came 'cause they must to pick up cargo that Triplanetary Top Gear's ship accidentally left inside nebula - some filming equipment, provisions - so they need charting data as well
Ar aboard construction ship - the ship represents the company that built and programmed the ship, like Palpatene they came to oversee what's wrong with Death Star they'd built
Bib aboard racing ship - they hear in the news and unlike Scar, they're leaping with joy - "wait a sec, if we get the data we can shortcut through nebula and win the race"
in words of Herb Welch, "so there you have it" - four parties orbiting the newer planet wanting to get to the ship

a word about our heroes
El - comes from a sandy planet with traditions so suffocating she chooses to leave - she disobeys her family and has to run days through desert to fly off planet
Cee - is an older civil officer who has his life set but realizes it's empty and seeks something he does not know yet, he leaves the service and joins a ship as a crew
Bib - leaves his successful education path chosen for him and follows his own dream - joins endurance racing ship as least team member
Ar - comes from a grey rocky isolated planet on the outskirts, he builds receiver to listen to galactic frequencies and learns about building and programming ship, vitaal technology and wants to do that

all of them are prorgammers on their respective ships, non-leading - reasearching, building, programming, competing
what the see is the sea - the ship emergency landed in a shallow see and is parked under the water miles from shore, not deep, can be seen even from orbit
so parties noticed each other, found out that all want ship data and now are communicating like "how do we get ship's data" - quite like Council of Elrond in Rivendell, but without clear Elrond here and it's not Rivendell, and the ring is on the ship
anyway, parties decide to program droids to send to the ship - 'cause it's under water and landing and walking not an option
each parties leaders gather their crew and ask to program dorids to do fly-enter-download-return
and - like M in Skyfall they continue to gather meetings and are non-stop "when" "what's the current progress" - thinking them drawing attention to themselves and asking to explain will improve and speed up creation process
it won't - all they do is trying to insert their "me, I", participate in what's happening by hijacking, forcing - instead of either letting programmers program or picking up on equal terms editor and programming themselves
typical, like captain Freeman from Lower Decks, when Ransom tells here an idea, she repeats it right away and he says "great idea, captain" - and we know Buffer Time episode is coming
so Ar, El, Bib, Cee - they come to their meetings on their ships and first respond, than explain less and finally - stand up, say "stop this distubance, only prevent program from happening" and don't go to further meetings
well, other programmers don't want the conflict so the keep coming and reporting
but you guessed it - who's simulations actually worked and worked best? that's right, Cee's Bib's Ar's and El's - in words of Geri from Toy Story "you cannot rush art"

now, all the parties exchange simulations and turns out El's perfroms best
so all four ships decide to send just one - El's - and then transmit data to everyone
El calls program Scotty - because Kirk always rushes him, "just give me two seconds, all right, you mad bastard!"
droid run by Scotty gets to the ship, enters and - unexpected happens: one of the core systems of the ship needed to access data is surprisignly off, and it's an plex older system
nobody, inclugin Ar's ship who actually came to repair their ship, happens to know that system and usually always works
the system has a port and a terminal - a small screen - which is also off
droid and Scotty connects to terminal but there's no understanding of what to do next

everyone is quite, because it is all heppening live and meetings won't help much
so even always-need-to-interfere leaders are quite
what's needed - a program, a way to turn the system on, then Scotty can complete the mission and deliver the galaxy to Arquillians
and because it's live, and El's program performed the best, everyone's like "let her program the system"
El names program Kuiil, becuase he is skillful and can craft anywhere from anything with anything
through port droids sends system's state and data, but it's difficult to make meaning of it
she creates a graphical interface that reflects state of the system that Kuiil receives as data from the system through port
what they see is a black and white visualization - nestining varying cirles with triangle in the middle and lines that segment the rings that cirles from
the outer and some others look are like energy and are represented by cardio-like line
the system is off - there are shapes that look like shouldn't be there and lines are broken or cirles are not exactly cirles - off like Megaminds evil plans
Kuiil shows state of the system, and since it's and older system, El has repl to input changes to bring state to work and consequently system online
well, Jason Bourne remembers who he is and Kuiil does it - droids gets the data, unlike me when i didn't get my clothes
