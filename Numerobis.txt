if there something strange in the neighbourhood, who you gonna call? that's right, and sanity - well, Jesus first, to bust 'em ghosts
Ner is on a very industrial and populated multi-paradigm planet  - pretty much diverse like the Battle of Five Armies
there's something strange - there's a belief age and deseases are connected
she wonders - can i be healthy just eathing plants? and she hears on her very developed planet - "you cant't" "it's not possible"
and she calls - she wants to be healthy like an elf and starts searching what's wrong - and she finds whole plant based foods and turns her health around and heals like Wolverine
now, what drives her nuts is the why - besides no reason, of course, that she gets - rather what makes people eat blunt animal products when there's a whole plant based foods party going on?
and what do you know - like Moos heard my remark that we hate bad reviews - Ner wanders Earth internet and finds out about Impossible Foods, their mission and that they have figured out the secret - heme, James heme
so she is fascinated that Impossible Foods are taking on the animal agriculture in a fair competetion - they will outperform them in their own race, making meat out of plants
she, of course, is sane and does not need that - who needs frog dogs when we have lentils and Smoking Gun II coming out? - so she wouldn't eat those but that would heal the environment and is merciful, and wise like Saruman
like Earth has it, her plant has it same, so she decides to program a program who would combine 
she names program Numerobis, because he searches for magic potion
