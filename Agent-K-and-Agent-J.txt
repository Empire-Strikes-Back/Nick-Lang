who's nuts enough to think about it? Ar
there's a Nuts esport in Triplanetary Galaxy - players compete in games who use programming language as gameplay - sss-smmmokin!
programmers program games and put them out there, free and open source - best ones become standard and are played competitively in tournaments
Ar loves Nuts - like Pierce says in Logan from the back of Wolverine's car - "i'm a fan"
he's mind is at building and programming ships using Vitaal technology, that's why he joined construction ship
yet he just can't help it and is itchingly curious - how processor works? and why isn't there a light processor so that computers wouldn't require cooling and be cool, like Dougie becomes Dougee in Cool SNL sketch
so he's like - wait a minute, there can be a game, no two games - in first players program a processor and in second - we can imagine, but for real, and inspire - a light processor
yes, we don't have all the tech to build a model of one physically, but we have programming and can draw what it would look like and visualize, simulate how it would work
and the best - like Agent J mocks "best of the best, Captain America" - those will be games for Nuts
Ar first names programs Cashews and Coconut, but then gives them real names: Agent K - "old and busted", processor, and Agent J - "new hotness", light processor
these are tough nuts to crack for Ar, he's not rushing, but the dream is alive - in words of Shredder, it's aalliive!
and by the way, Ar knows nothing about processor, electricity or anything - "won't you lose your driving permis? don't worry, monsieur, i have no permis"
