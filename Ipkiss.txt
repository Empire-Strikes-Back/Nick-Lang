Erra is crew member on plex charting ship
like Donatello turtle, he does machines, more specifically - he programs next charting program for newer planets
but what did you expect - it's a plex ship, so all is covered with oil, sugar, flour, is processed and wrapped
Erra is the main dude on the next charting program, and he wanted better, but the program turns out plex and he hates it, about the same degree as cat pokemon hates water
and the worst - he is the lead programmer and there's much noise and discussions with little value comming out - like Sherlock would say, sickly sweet nanny-ing instead of program for users
he knows he is better off being programmer period
anyway, litte result, 90% of his time and energy spent on the program, most of which is wasted on discussions, questions and blame
and and and  - he is loves and gravitates towards space navigational programs, one that ships use to plot a course in space
and both - navigational and charting - plex, dark,heavy, oily, bloated and quickly become unprogrammable
Erra is frustrated and constantly explodes like Hades from Hercules - "why programs are so heavy and are a maze? and why closed source? should be lighter, should be on vitaal technology, and duh - open source"
he takes a leave from duty for a month thinking it will free him up
and rushes to program navigational program and names him Ipkiss
what Erra thinks is - this navigational programs are heavy, cuase they bring all the networking along with computation, why not program them computation only and export/import a file to be sent within existing networks? 
so Ipkiss is not Mask - where are the keys, Milo? - he is light, computation only, get file in and out and networks are networks - separately
but he finds he is even more pressured: before he was "do this, do this", now on vacation - he still has no peace 'cause he kind of gives up his posisiton and added to that - being pressured on time
but he realizes - wait a minute, i was wrong - bad footwork as Kobe would say - they told me "will you be the lead programmer?" and i passively silently accepted
and before - he realizes - i was always passive like "tell me what to do" and than sour and bitter about it
so it's not that i lacked time, it's that i never said what i'm gonna do, and the time i need
as Nick Cage from the Cage would cry "would you calm down?!" - so Erra calms down, goes and says "i'm not lead nothing anymore, i'll program Ipkiss - he'll be free open source navigation program, i'll need 6 months"
obviously, Saruman-like reaction when Gandalf defends freedom of Thorin's quest is there, but Erra knows and others know he is valuable and better have hime anyway
badaboom - he gets his program and freedom to finally cook some whole plant foods dish with almost no noise around - like agent M says: "i. found. youuu"
and not-hinding Erra gets a gift from Elrond - gets Isildur's broken blade pieces forged back together - he is like "aah!! con nichon aah!! it's not networks that make program heavy, but how we use them"
so instead of making Ipkiss be less reachable for users because no netwroks, Erra programs him using libraries for networking, all light and open source and cooks Ipkiss with distributed hash table inside so he's complete dish, but whole plant based, free and open source
