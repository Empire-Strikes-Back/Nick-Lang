Cee is part of the crew at a transport ship that operates on the edges near the newer planets
he programs various ship systems, like Namomi and Amos, but by himself obviously
the ship comes to one of the newer planets, uninhabited but with quite rich vegetation: in words of Buzz Lightyear - plants, plants everywhere
they are there to pick up cargo left by scietific research mission
so ship leaders gathers crew and agrees on a program that droids will run to load cargo - and - the simulation shows that in the process they will rip and stomp the garden the planet is as it's nothing
Cee speaks up - like ehh, Grey Poupon, Billy? we can program droids to do the same and keep all plants unharmed 
no, only frog dog - some others agree but leaders decline because - you guessed right - they don't want to be right, they want to be in charge and cause-I-say-so, plant coming from them is more important than what's better
and nobody opposes much, discussion silently dies, couple of jokes and everyone agrees - tommorrow droids will run program, load, and we out of here like the crew of the ship in Alien wants off the planet soon
anyway, for Cee it doesn't sink in and he decides to risk it all but do the right thing: not quite like Jesus - give life for friends, but still - sabotage to save plants
and whats most annoying - there is no reason not to, it's not faster nor anyhting to not damage life on planet, leaders just want their way for literally no reason
so Cee decides to program a program and without permission replace the damaging one so that droids do gather cargo and keep plants untouched
this whole insanity reminds him of Saruman's orcs destroying trees of Isengard and Fangorn so he calls the program Treebeard
he substitues the program, Treebeard runs, everyone quite soon realizes something is wrong, but it's too late so they watch the load - Treebeard and droids do load carge, plants are affected and - do it faster than planned simulation
so anyway, Lord Farquaad is mad, metting called, who what why how dare, Cee jeks and like "what? i thought faster is better"
he gets cold treatment from some of crew, some understand but ship don't kick him off or anything - just warn and such, but he continues
and more - some of leadership after comes to him and say - so and so, you decisivenss and skill, join higher ranks but Cee wisely declines
he is smart and knows the value he has as programmer and mechanic to program and build and have freedom and more impact, he doesn't go higher but forward instead - like Dredd stays street judge in the end of the movie
