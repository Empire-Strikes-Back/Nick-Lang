Jaas programs gravitational editor at one fo the newer planets
there is only one paradigm present as of yet - samll but growing plex city - where Jaas and machine are
gravitational editor looks like a pavilion from Jurassic Park - metal under 45-ish degree fence around with horizaontal tubes
droids and ships for quickness of offload drop cargo from air into editor area and it changes gravity so that cargo does not hit but softly lands
in theory, in practice - it's plex technology and programming and cargo falls sideways or does not decelerate enough
so Jabba the Hutt tells Jaas Solo to make it work
but when Jaas looks inside editor's program he finds a plex dish of oily spaghetti with level one carcinogen - meat - on the side
the maze is scarier than the one in Goblet of Fire, Jaas feels chained like me when Moos cuffed me to the couch
Jaas decides enough is enough and decides to write a program using vitaal technology - he names program Hermione - so that Wingardium Leviosa of the editor works as expected and not as Ron casted it
he first rushes to program in private hidden, while still working on the current program, but realizes it's wrong and tears him apart - he thinks though the program and goes and tells to Jabba he's gonna do it and needs time
can you jump into hyperspace from handgar? "i never aksed that question until after i've done it"
he gets his time and programs Hermione
the graphical visualization of editor looks like layers - horizontal lines - from thinner on top to thicker at the bottom
when Hermione's program is off, line thickness is chaotic, lines are wavy or broken, under angles and there are other geometrical shapes - like cirles, arcs, triangles - gravitaonal obsticles that cargo hits and falls sideways
Jaas programs her to be on using that amazing light simple graphical representation of editor's state
