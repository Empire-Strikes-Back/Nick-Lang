Maar lives on a one-big-city-like populated plex planet
she graduated and was on her path of becoming something she did not actually want
but she fell into the cauldron of magic potion - she discovered programming
"you've never programmed before!" - yep, just like Ed Sheeran who's never driven before Top Gear lap, and what a lap
so she joined it with her love for sailing sport - she programs plex program who allows scientist to program aquatic automated research and data collecting vessels
but she soon was "what's happening?!" "am i crazy to think it's crazy" - just like Agent J on Z's funeral during O's speech
program was full of ads, had paid functionality tiers, on top of being closed source, and with popups - would you like some waffles?
it's crap Angie, it's crap!
did i mention it's a plex technology program? Maar has it - she wants better, a special, a true delicious mango, not fried bacon under mayonnaise, and she knows so do users - scientists and sportsmen like her
and like muses sing in Hercules - a star is born - she names the program Jar-Jar - monsters out dere, leakin in here, all sinkin an no power? when are yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?!
she first rushes to start programming, but stops - first goes and tells she's gonna progrma Jar-Jar, he's gonna be light, no ads, completely free and open source for all to users
Jar-Jar is simple - has editor on the left and graphically shows water and vessels and their trajectories on the right - real party, like Naboo's Freedom Day, but with less pretence
